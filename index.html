          sure every person in our global supply chain is safe at work and has
          their rights respected and protected. We set high ethical standards
          and support our suppliers to help them meet them. Our priorities

          <strong> ASOS Foundation </strong> We set up the ASOS Foundation
          because we believe everyone deserves access to the same opportunities.
          It achieved full charity status in 2013 and provides infrastructure,
          training and support to enable disadvantaged young adults to reach
          their potential.‚ÄØOur mission is to inspire young people to break down
          barriers and, ultimately, to achieve amazing things.‚ÄØWe have so many
          experts in fashion and tech who love to pass on their talent through
          the Foundation ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of our favourite parts of being ASOS, and we
          hope we can change lives.

          so we work with more than 200 models to represent our audience. And
          we‚Äôre not in the business of digitally altering their appearance
          either‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reshaping or removing stretch marks here. Our
          models are part of the ASOS family and we support them by following a
          Model Welfare Policy.‚ÄØ To learn more please visit:
